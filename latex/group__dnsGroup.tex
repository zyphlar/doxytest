\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
The current DNS system is agnostic about the use of IPADDR, IPADDR6 or IPADDR4. The capability of C++ is such that you pass in any of those types and the compiler will select the correct function for that type. This is a change from tools versions 3.\+4.\+0 and earlier in which explicit IPv4 and IPv6 functions were used.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
While we are pointing out the automatic functionality in this DNS API, the same is true for most functions, structures and classes throughout the API libraries.
